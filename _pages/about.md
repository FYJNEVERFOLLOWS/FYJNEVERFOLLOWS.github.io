<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I study at [CCA Lab](http://cic.tju.edu.cn/faculty/wanglongbiao/labs.html) as a postgraduate now, focusing on DL-based Audio and Speech Signal Processing research. Feel free to reach me at fyjneverfollows[AT]gmail[DOT]com or fyjneverfollows[AT]163[DOT]com.

I graduated from College of [Computer Science and Technology](https://it.ouc.edu.cn/cs/main.htm), Ocean University of China with a bachelor's degree. Currently, I am pursuing a master of philosophy's degree, supervised by **[Prof. Longbiao Wang](http://cic.tju.edu.cn/faculty/wanglongbiao/wang.html)** and **[Prof. Jianwu Dang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Wk5ApskAAAAJ)** at Tianjin University.

My research interest includes multi-channel speech separation and microphone array signal processing. I have published 4 papers at the top international speech and AI conferences.

<!-- I am also a contributor of the open source project, [SpeechBrain](https://github.com/speechbrain/speechbrain), working with enthusiastic members including [Mirco Ravanelli](https://sites.google.com/site/mircoravanelli/) and [Titouan Parcollet](http://www.darnault-parcollet.fr/). -->

- We propose an end-to-end beamforming network for 2D location guided speech separation merely given mixture signal, estimating discriminable direction and 2D location cues, which are then integrated into location-aware neural beamformer, allowing accurate reconstruction of two sources' speech.
