<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I study at [CCA Lab](http://cic.tju.edu.cn/faculty/wanglongbiao/labs.html) as a postgraduate now, focusing on DL-based Audio and Signal Processing research. Feel free to reach me at fyjneverfollows[AT]gmail[DOT]com or fyjneverfollows[AT]163[DOT]com.

I graduated from College of [Computer Science and Technology](https://it.ouc.edu.cn/cs/main.htm), Ocean University of China (中国海洋大学计算机科学与技术学院) with a bachelor's degree. Currently, I am pursuing a master of philosophy's degree, supervised by **[Prof. Longbiao Wang (王龙标)](http://cic.tju.edu.cn/faculty/wanglongbiao/wang.html)** and **[Prof. Jianwu Dang (党建武)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Wk5ApskAAAAJ)** at Tianjin University.

<!-- I won the National Scholarship (top 1% of high school undergraduates). -->

My research interest includes speech separation, speech enhancement and microphone array signal processing. I have published 2 papers at the top international speech and AI conferences.
